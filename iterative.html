            <div id="overview" class="intro">
                <p>For this project, I worked in a team to design an app for a vintage wholesale marketplace start-up with feedback and user testing. I had a great time growing my prototyping skills and experiencing the design process as a team.</p>

                <h2>I. Pre-Design Thinking</h2>
                <p> We chose to design Fleek, which is a B2B Wholesale marketplace for second-hand fashion. This startup is targeted at a younger, millennial or Gen-Z audience (hence the name). Buyers can buy clothing in bulk, often in the form of bundles, directly from the seller. Buyers are comprised largely of vintage stores and online resellers. Suppliers include clothing wholesalers, rag-houses, and donation centers.
                </p>
                <p>We chose to design a mobile interface because it's easier to snap and then upload pictures this way, the mobile interface makes it feel more interpersonal between buyers and sellers, the service is targeted towards a younger and trendier audience, and finally, it creates a more social-media like experience that will hopefully make the user feel like they're doing something fun rather than working.</p>

                <h2>II. Five Minute Sketches</h2>
                <p> With the aforementioned ideas in mind, we each created a variety sketches to imagine what this interface might look like.

                <h4>Notes on our design decisions:</h4>
    
                    <p>
                    We decided at first to create an app the worked for the buyer and the seller, where you would choose which one you wanted to be when you first set up an account. However, we ultimately decided in response to the critique that this was confusing and difficult for people who may want to do both.
                    
                    We decided on a navigation bar at the bottom for easy, thumb-accessibe navigation, and we felt that it was important to have a search page where you could discover, search and filter items, a chat page where you could negotiate possible deals and connect with sellers/buyers, and a profile page including your favorited/saved items. Searching is of course very important functionality, but we wanted to add a profile and chat to foster more interpersonal connection.

                <h2>IV. High Fidelity Mockup</h2>
                <p> We presented our first draft of mockups to our peers in critique, and in response to the feedback we recieved, we added the chat and home screens, removed the option to be a seller as were told that this option was confusing and figured the buyer and seller functions would be best implemented as two different apps. We also added a list of favorited items and functionality to view order history, as per the crit feedback.

                <h2>V. User Testing</h2>
                <p> We conducted user tests in order to test the efficiency of our design solutions. We came up with a blurb, tasks, and post-task questions for our users:
                </p>
                <h4>

                <p>
                
                    This is not an actual website but an interactive mockup made on prototyping software. You are a vintage shop called Nostalgia and you are buying wholesale vintage Harley Davidson t-shirts for your shop. This website allows you to find businesses that sell vintage wholesale products and buy their products.

                <h2>VI. User Testing Analysis</h2>
                <p>The overall task we gave was to shop for a specific item bundle and add it to their cart, which we split into the following subtasks: ‚Äúsearch vintage tops, filter for the Harley Davidson brand and select the Harley Tees Bundle, then add the bundle to your cart.‚Äù The users were successful for each task and generally described the interface as ‚Äúeasy to use and navigate‚Äù.
                </p>
                <p>While most users did not face many issues, a point of error/confusion was the quantity vs amount of pieces shown when shopping. Specifically, we ask the user to add a bundle to their cart, which includes 20 pieces, but the quantity is listed as 1 because each bundle is 20 pieces. Users found that it might be a bit confusing to list the quantity as 1 instead of 20.
                </p>
                <p>
                Users were able to complete the tasks successfully and pretty efficiently, though one user was unsure of completing a task because for our search function, the user simply clicks the search bar, instead of typing the actual query.
                </p>
                <p>Potential interface changes we could make are clearly indicating that each bundle includes X pieces, so we can put conversions for the quantities. For example, if each bundle includes 20 pieces, picking quantity 1 will show (20pc), quantity 2 (40pc), etc. As well, we could have live time assistance with an employee through our chat feature, which one user was hoping to see.
